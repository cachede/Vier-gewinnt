My own very simple implementation of the local two player game Vier gewinnt (Four Connect) written in C + raylib for all the rendering.
The current build only works on Windows right now.

## The Build
1. clone the repository: $ git clone https://github.com/cachede/Vier-gewinnt.git
2. Go into the project directory/folder: $ cd Vier-gewinnt
3. Run the Makefile: $ make
4. Binary is in directory/folder bin/: $ ./bin/main.exe

To clean all intermediate files and binary run: $ make clean

## Sidenote
In order to run make on windows you could have for example the w64-devkit (https://github.com/skeeto/w64devkit).
